This project homework is done in some weeks, was truly long, and hard to do, for a beginner in web development. But it was really pleasant to do it, and I have learned so much things in this domain. 
So I used a lot the IA to help me understand things that I haven't check until this moment. 
I can't say now I will be a pro in development without difficulties, but I always do what I gotta do, and I do it with a lot of heart.
